# What is Git?

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects efficiently. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project by tracking changes, managing versions, and enabling collaboration.

- **Created by:** Linus Torvalds in 2005  
- **Primary Purpose:** Manage source code and track changes over time in a collaborative development environment.

---

## Key Features of Git
- **Distributed:** Every developer has a full copy of the repository.  
- **Branching and Merging:** Allows experimentation with features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.  
- **Lightweight:** Efficient in terms of performance and storage.  
- **Integrity:** Ensures data integrity using cryptographic hash functions (SHA-1).  
- **Speed:** Optimized for fast operations (commits, branches, merges).

## What is a Version Control System (VCS)?
A **Version Control System (VCS)** helps manage changes to source code over time. It allows developers to:
- Track changes  
- Collaborate effectively  
- Revert to previous versions if needed  
- Identify who made changes and when  

---

## Types of VCS

### 1. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
- A single, central repository stores all the versions of code.  
- Developers pull code from the central server, work on it, then commit changes back.  
- **Examples:** Subversion (SVN), Perforce, CVS  

**Advantages**
- Simple to understand and implement  
- Centralized control ensures consistency  

**Disadvantages**
- Single point of failure  
- Limited offline capabilities  

**Workflow Example (CVCS)**
1. Developer A checks out code from the central repository  
2. Developer A modifies and commits it back  
3. Developer B pulls the latest changes

### 2. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
- Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including history.  
- Work offline, commit locally, then sync later.  
- **Examples:** Git, Mercurial, Bazaar  

**Advantages**
- Full offline access  
- Redundancy (every clone is a backup)  
- Better collaboration with branching and merging  

**Disadvantages**
- More disk space needed  
- Steeper learning curve  

**Workflow Example (DVCS)**
1. Developer A clones the repository  
2. Developer A commits changes locally  
3. Developer A pushes to the remote; Developer B pulls changes

## Git vs. Centralized VCS

| Feature             | CVCS (e.g., SVN)            | DVCS (e.g., Git)         |
|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Repository Structure | Single central server        | Each developer has a full copy |
| Offline Work         | Limited or none              | Full offline capabilities |
| Speed                | Slower (network-dependent)   | Faster (local operations) |
| Backup               | Single point of failure      | Every clone is a backup   |
| Branching            | Expensive and slow           | Lightweight and fast      |
